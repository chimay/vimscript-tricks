VimL is full of features, but sometimes it is hard to find which function
or command will do the job you want.

If you ever searched the web for `vim script ex command output in a var`,
you surely have had results talking about `:redir`. This is ok, but
there is a more elegant solution for this particular problem.

This wiki collects vim script snippets, whose some were hard to find. You
may already know some of them, and I hope you will gladly discover
the others.
